# Options Pricing Tool in Python
This tool allows you to price call and put option using the black-scholes merton model for options pricing.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Pandas, MatplotLib, Numpy, and Scipy

Classes were used to make this project useful for those implementing more complex Portfolio analysis tools in Python. The Stock class represents an abstraction for historical data, including therefore all abstraction based on data such as variance. On the other hand, the Option class focuses on the contractual nature of the deriviative, while Option_PnL focuses on evaluating the sentsitivity of the derivative (greeks) and the price of the option given a series of final stock prices with +/- 3 sigma.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but also functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!

## Lessons Learned:

No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have those *whoa this is awesome* or *wow I actually did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
